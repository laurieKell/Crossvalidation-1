The most commonly used statistic to assess the strength of patterns is Mohn’s $\rho$ a measure of relative error

\begin{equation}\rho = \overline{ \left[ \frac{X_{Y-p,ref}-X_{Y-y,ref}}{X_{Y-y,ref}} \right]}\end{equation}

where $X$ is the quantity for which Mohn’s $\rho$ is being calculated, $Y$ the final year of the simulation, $y$ the last year of a given “peel” $p$, and $ref$ the reference peel, i.e. the most recent assessment.

The difference between the reference ($X{ref}$) the alternative peeled model ($X{p}$) is calculated using the relative error 

\begin{equation} RE=\frac{X_{p}-X_{ref}}{X_{ref}} \end{equation}

While it is fairly straightforward to compare the  statistic among alternative model runs, the decisions of whether the Mohn’s $\rho$ statistic of the ‘best’ model is acceptable or not can be to some extent subjective. To address this, a “rule of thumb” was proposed by \cite{hurtado2014}, suggesting values of Mohn’s $\rho$ that fall outside the range (-0.15 to 0.20) can be interpreted as an indication of an undesirable retrospective pattern for e.g. longer lived species.
